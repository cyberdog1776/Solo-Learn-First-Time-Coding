# Solo-Learn-First-Time-Coding
#Python Beginner, Intermediate, and Core Projects
#Hello World!
#As a midlife career change, I got a Computer Support Specialist AAS 2020-2022.
#After a year of working in K-12 Education, flirting with network engineering, and wanting to start in cloud.
#After applying for thousands of jobs, the only job I secured was as an Associate Tech Support position with Infosys.
#So they tried to teach me some SQL & some Python. (Wasn't very good.)
#Now I want to learn how to code because it is fun to learn.
#Python is fun to learn.
#Learning and gaining viable employment is fun.
